1 When Abram was ninety-nine years old the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, ``I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless, 2 that I may make my covenant between me and you, and may multiply you greatly.'' 3 Then Abram fell on his face. And God said to him, 4 ``Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations. 5 No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. 6 I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make you into nations, and kings shall come from you. 7 And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you. 8 And I will give to you and to your offspring after you the land of your sojourning, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.'' \bv{Genesis}{(17:1-8)}

1 And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness 2 for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days. And when they were ended, he was hungry. 3 The devil said to him, ``If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.'' 4 And Jesus answered him, ``It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone.''' 5 And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, 6 and said to him, ``To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will. 7 If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.'' 8 And Jesus answered him, ``It is written, ``'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.''' 9 And he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, ``If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, 10 for it is written,``'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,' 11 and ``'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.''' 12 And Jesus answered him, ``It is said, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.''' 13 And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time. \bv{Luke}{(4:1-13)}

25 And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” 26 He said to him, “What is written in the Law? How do you read it?” 27 And he answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.” 28 And he said to him, “You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.” \bv{Luke}{(14:25-27)}
