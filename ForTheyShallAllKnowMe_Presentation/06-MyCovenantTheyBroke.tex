\note[item]{Today, we're talking about how the Israelites rejected God's covenant}
\note[item]{Someone brought up a few weeks ago that a covenant is much more serious than a contract, and that's certainly true when it comes to covenants dealing with our eternal soul.}
\note[item]{However, Christians of the denominational world also make a big (false) distinction between covenants and contracts}
\note[item]{The difference, they say, is that in a covenant, one part is guaranteeing to hold up their end of the covenant even if the other party doesn't.}
\note[item]{They use this to say that even if Israel was unfaithful, God is still going to restore them physically in the millennial kingdom.}
\note[item]{They'd also note that since God has made a New Covenant, He will save the chosen regardless of how they behave}
\note[item]{We're going to study today that that's clearly not the case.}

\note{09:34}
\note[item]{In the last lesson, we talked about the love that God showed to the children of Israel, and to us, like the love a husband has for His wife.}
\note[item]{Unfortunately, Israel, in general, rejected God's love}
\note[item]{Serving God, as we have discussed, is always voluntary.}
\note[item]{But, there will be consequences for unfaithfulness.}
\end{frame}

%--------------------------------------
\begin{goals}
\goal Summarize how Israel rejected God's love under the Old Covenant
\goal Examine the consequences of rejecting God's love for Israel and for
us
\goal Develop a plan to prevent falling away from God

\note{09:35}
\note[item]{We'll be considering 3 different passages today}
\note[item]{Lev. 26, one of many passages in the Old Law that lists the blessings for following God and the consequences for disobedience}
\note[item]{Heb. 3, where the writer warns Christians against following the rebellious example of the Israelites.}
\note[item]{Rom. 9:30-33, in which Paul says that Israel did not achieve righteousness from the Law because they lacked faith.}
\note[item]{For each passage we'll consider, in what ways Israel rejected God and the consequences they suffered because of that reject}
\note[item]{Finally, we'll try to learn from their bad example and think about how to prevent rejecting God's love.}

\note{09:37}
\note[item]{The writer of Hebrews has been discussing how Christ is superior to the Moses.}
\note[item]{And, he's warning Christians not to reject Jesus like the children of Israel rejected God in the wilderness.}
\note[item]{Read 7-9, 16-20}
\note[item]{It's instructive to think about, what the Israelites did to reject God in the wilderness}
\note[item]{We immediately think about the golden calf, and their complaining every time they had to struggle a bit}
\note[item]{But, the incident that's specifically referred to in Hebrews is their lack of faith at the spies report when they were about to enter the land of Canaan.}
