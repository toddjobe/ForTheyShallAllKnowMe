\begin{goals}
\goal Understand what the New Covenant is
\goal Examine why the New Covenant was needed
\goal Assess how God's relationship with His people changed from the Old to the New Covenants

\note{09:36}
\note[item]{A little different this week.  We'll look at 5 scriptures and think about what the New Covenants is, why it was needed, and what changed from the Old Covenant to the New Covenant.}

\section{What is the New Covenant?}

%--------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{The New Covenant vs. the Old}
\framesubtitle{Jer. 31:31-34}

\begin{description}[from the least to the greatest]
\item[I will put my law within them] genuine obedience
\item[I will write it on their hearts] inward commitment
\item[I will be their God] a new focus
\item[they shall be my people] it's no longer physical Israel
\item[\ldots they shall all know me] faith not genealogy
\item[from the least to the greatest] every Christian's a priest
\item[I will forgive their iniquities] more than overlooking sins
\end{description}

\note{09:36}
\note[item]{A prep for the last 5 lessons.}
\note[item]{law within them -- Christians focus on commitment from the heart not outward rituals (\emph{e.g.}, Pharisees,`whitewashed tombs')}
\note[item]{write it on hearts -- not tablets.  Israelites should have done this (law `when you rise up and lay down').  Christians will get it right.}
\note[item]{I will be their God -- Christians are God's new focus}
\note[item]{They shall be my people -- no longer physical Israel}
\note[item]{\ldots they shall all know me -- from 'no longer teach\ldots' forward says you don't have to teach a Christian how to be saved.  All Christians already `know' God. Not true in the OT. You could be born an Israelite but grow up not knowing the Lord.}
\note[item]{least to greatest -- no distinction between clergy/laity, jews/gentiles, rich/poor, etc.}
\note[item]{forgive their iniquity -- You'll need a better sacrifice for this.}

\note{09:38}
\note[item]{Jesus talks about both the kingdom and the new covenant being associated with his sacrifice}
\note[item]{Two part of a contract are mentioned here.}
\note[item]{The first is payment for services rendered.}
\note[item]{Note the Jesus says that \emph{he} is paying for \emph{our} side of the contract.}
\note[item]{Second, there's a signature, which really is ratification of the contract.}
\note[item]{When Jesus dies the New Covenant is ratified.}
\note[item]{\emph{If someone says ratification is Pentecost, then I'd say Pentecost is the date of effect.  It's ratified before, but the start date is 50 days later. But, we'll not take the analogy too far.}}

\note[item]{Jesus is the cornerstone}
\note[item]{Apostles and prophets build on it}

\note[item]{For instance, judging of the wicked, who by their actions reject the sacrifice of Jesus.}

\begin{column}{0.6\textwidth}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We were dead in sins (1-9)
		\item We are Gentiles in the flesh(11-21)
	\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\end{columns}

\note{09:38}
\note[item]{We needed the new covenant because without it we're dead, both physically and spiritually}
\note[item]{We're Gentiles: Excluded from citizenship of Israel, Foreigners to the covenant of promise, Without Hope, Without God}
\note[item]{Does this mean \emph{no} Gentiles were saved in the OT? \emph{Of course not, (e.g. Ruth), but the plan certainly didn't focus on salvation for the whole world.}}

\begin{frame}{Animal sacrifices are insufficient}

\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.6\textwidth}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The Law cannot perfect the worshipers (1-2)
		\item The sacrifices can't really take away sins (3-4)
		\item God doesn't really want animal sacrifice and offering\ldots 
		\item He wants a human offering (5-7)
	\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\end{columns}

\note{09:38}
\note[item]{The argument is that if the sacrifices take away sins, then you don't have to keep offering them.}
\note[item]{Think about this in the context of the catholic practice of penance.}
\note[item]{Penance is basically punishing yourself for sins you committed and has to be done over again when you commit another sin.}
\note[item]{The Hebrew writer would reject such practices on the basis that Jesus' sacrifice is sufficient for the sins you have committed in the past, \emph{and} the sins you will commit in the future.}
\note[item]{Don't continue to beat yourself up over past sins.}
\note[item]{And, don't fret over the `cursing as I die in a car crash' conundrum of unconfessed sin.}

		\item Everyone had to be consigned to disobedience
		\item So, a partial hardening came on Israel
		\item Until the Gentiles came in

\end{column}

\note{09:38}
\note[item]{Paul makes the same point in chapters 1-3 culminating in v23 `for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God'}
\note[item]{The hardening of Israel served to bring the Gentiles in by\ldots}
\note[item]{Killing Jesus}
\note[item]{Persecuting the church so that the gospel spread to all places}
