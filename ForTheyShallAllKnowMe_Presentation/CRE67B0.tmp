\note[item]{Clearly God thinks it's important that we view Him as the only God.}
\note[item]{It's not just that His people accept Him as the `true' God.  But as `their' God}

\note[item]{God's people will be special because He chose them.}
\note[item]{But, also because they chose Him.}
\note[item]{And, we're not different because we're somehow innately better than the world.}

	\emph{`added because of transgressions'}\\People tend to fall off the path\\~\\
	\emph{`a mediator is not for just one person, but God is one'}\\ Because Moses gave the Law to the Israelites, they didn't have a first hand relationship with God.\\~\\
	\emph{`was our guardian until Christ'}\\The Old Law constrained people to holy living when they didn't know much about the `plan'.
\end{column}
\end{columns}

\note{09:45}
\note[item]{The Message: The purpose of the law was to keep a sinful people in the way of salvation until Christ (the descendant) came, inheriting the promises and distributing them to us. Obviously this law was not a firsthand encounter with God. It was arranged by angelic messengers through a middleman, Moses. But if there is a middleman as there was at Sinai, then the people are not dealing directly with God, are they? But the original promise is the direct blessing of God, received by faith.}
\note[item]{The Old Covenant was a `guardian' to let people know what holy living looked like, until Jesus came}
\note[item]{But there were problems that came in how people used the Old Law\ldots}

\note[item]{Just as Jesus sacrificed Himself for us when we He wasn't loved in return, we should also give unselfishly to our spouse.}
\note[item]{Just like Jesus, though, we can hope that by our loving deeds, love will be returned.}
\note[item]{We do the same thing in marriage.}

\section{The New Covenant}

\begin{frame}{The New Covenant vs. the Old}
\framesubtitle{Jer. 31:31-34}

\begin{description}[from the least to the greatest]
\item[I will put my law within them] genuine obedience
\item[I will write it on their hearts] inward commitment
\item[I will be their God] a new focus
\item[they shall be my people] it's no longer physical Israel
\item[\ldots they shall all know me] faith not genealogy
\item[from the least to the greatest] there's no distinctions
\item[I will forgive their iniquities] more than overlooking sins
\end{description}

\note{09:40}
\note[item]{write it on hearts -- not tablets.  Israelites should have done this (law `when you rise up and lay down').  Christians will get it right.}
\note[item]{God's covenant will become part of who we are}
\note[item]{Again, a separation existed in the Old Covenant.}
\note[item]{The separation was partly institutional, but mostly it was that people didn't internalize God's law.}
