\begin{bible}
\bv{ISamuel}{(16:7)}
7 But the Lord said to Samuel, ``Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.''

\bv{Deuteronomy}{(10:12-15)}
12 ``And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, 13 and to keep the commandments and statutes of the Lord, which I am commanding you today for your good? 14 Behold, to the Lord your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth with all that is in it. 15 Yet the Lord set his heart in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them, you above all peoples, as you are this day.''

\bv{IICorinthians}{(4:16-18)}
16 So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. 17 For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, 18 as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.

\bv{Hebrews}{(4:1-13)}
Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it. 2 For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened. 3 For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said,

\begin{quote}
``As I swore in my wrath,`They shall not enter my rest,'\thinspace''
\end{quote}

although his works were finished from the foundation of the world. 4 For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: ``And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.'' 5 And again in this passage he said,

\begin{quote}
``They shall not enter my rest.''
\end{quote}

6 Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience, 7 again he appoints a certain day, ``Today,'' saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted,

\begin{quote}
``Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.''
\end{quote}

8 For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken of another day later on. 9 So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God, 10 for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his.

11 Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience. 12 For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. 13 And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.

\bv{Ezra}{(7:10)}
For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the Lord, and to do it and to teach his statutes and rules in Israel.

\bv{Romans}{(12:1-2)}
1 I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. 2 Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.

Written on their hearts as opposed to simply written on tablets of stone.
