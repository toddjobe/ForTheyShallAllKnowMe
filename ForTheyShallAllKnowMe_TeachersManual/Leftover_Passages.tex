\bvh{Leviticus}{(11:41-47)}

41 ``All the creatures that swarm on the earth are detestable; they must not be eaten.  42 Do not eat any of the creatures that swarm on the earth, anything that moves on its belly or walks on all fours or on many feet, for they are detestable.  43 Do not become contaminated by any creature that swarms; do not become unclean or defiled by them.  44 For I am Yahweh your God, so you must consecrate yourselves and be holy because I am holy. You must not defile yourselves by any swarming creature that crawls on the ground.  45 For I am Yahweh, who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God, so you must be holy because I am holy.

46 ``This is the law concerning animals, birds, all living creatures that move in the water, and all creatures that swarm on the ground,  47 in order to distinguish between the unclean and the clean, between the animals that may be eaten and those that may not be eaten.''
